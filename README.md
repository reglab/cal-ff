# Cal-FF Github Repository

This repository contains much of the code used to collate and curate Cal-FF.

Cal-FF is a comprehensive dataset of Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs) in California, compiled using satellite imagery, computer vision, and human validation. It provides an improved and near-complete census of CAFOs, addressing gaps in administrative records.

This dataset has redacted some publicly-available information, including facility addresses, in order to protect privacy. Because these are highly regulated facilities and addresses are a key method of performing record linkage and using this data in research, we will share this data for research purposes upon request.

Note: the animal type data described below is not available in the geoparquet, but it is in the geojson file.

## Dataset Details

### Dataset Description

Cal-FF includes facility locations, ownership records, satellite images, and detailed annotations. It was compiled to improve upon incomplete or inaccurate state administrative records.

## Uses

### Direct Use

- Improved CAFO location tracking
- Analysis of regulatory gaps
- Research on environmental and public health impacts of factory farming

## Dataset Contents

- **Facility Footprints**: Geospatial data about facility building footprint labels
- **Regulatory Data**: CAFO permits associated with facilities
- **Land use data**: Parcel information
- **Annotations**: Footprints, animal types, construction & destruction dates

## Dataset Creation

### Curation Rationale

To correct and expand upon existing CAFO datasets used in regulation and public health research.

### Source Data

#### Data Collection and Processing

- CV model used on satellite imagery to detect CAFOs
- Manual review by trained annotators
- Cross-referenced with state permit data and parcel maps

#### Who are the source data producers?

- Satellite imagery providers (e.g., Google)
- Public data sources (ReGrid parcel data; CWIQS CA permit data)
- Environmental Working Group (provided initial locations)
- CloudFactory labeling team
- Undergraduate research assistants

### Annotations

#### Annotation process

- Human-in-the-loop validation and correction of model predictions
- Labeling of animal types and facility boundaries

#### Who are the annotators?

- Undergraduate researchers
- CloudFactory contractors
- Authors

#### Personal and Sensitive Information

The dataset does not include private PII. Facility locations are publicly visible and cross-referenced with public parcel data.
